 |        Pull Request Guidelines for Pd           |
 ---------------------------------------------------


 * DESCRIPTIONS

   Please use a meaningful title and description for your PR.

   The title must be a short summary of the what your PR tries to
   accomplish.

 ** Commit messages

   Commit messages should also be meaningful and describe what the specific
   commit is used for.
   The commit message should make sense once GitHub is gone. It should
   also make sense if you do not have any internet access when reading it.

   Never ever use a subject of your commit message, that only consists
   of a "Closes" stanza.
   However, do add "Closes: https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/#..."
   to the *body* of commit message  (if the commit fixes issue #...)
   Please never use the short-form ("Closes: #...") as this might
   accidentally spill into other repositories.


 * TARGET BRANCHES

   PRs will typically be merged into the main branch shortly before a
   new release (if at all).
   If many many PRs have accumulated, a your PR might get overlooked,
   or conflict with another PR that got accepted.
   We therefore use meta-PRs that accumulate minor contributions.
   These meta-PRs will accept contributions much faster.

 ** 'develop' branch
   For small, simple bug-fixes (no new features!), please set the 'develop'
   branch as the base reference.
   As a general rule of thumb, PRs to the 'develop' branch should
   *never* include changes to .pd files (as it is just too easy to end up
   with unresolvable file conflicts).

 ** 'documentation' branch
   
   If you update only the documentation, please consider using the
   'documentation' branch as the base reference instead.
   This should only include changes to the documentation (help-patches, HTML).
   Other changes should either go into the develop branch or in specific
   feature-branches)


 * Crafted CODE

   The code in this repository is hand crafted, written (and owned) by real
   people.
   DO NOT create PRs for code or documentation that is generated by machine-
   learning tools (such as ChatGPT).
